It's my pleasure today, to introduce you to one of my closest Project that I had worked on. This Web application is called "WorkShare Scheduler". No prizes for guessing what it would do, but let me walk you through the roots of it. 

The idea of developing such application came up, when we all roommates were struggling to cope up with our assigned household jobs. Upon doing an initial survey followed by a paper prototyping with the students at the University, I was overwhelmed by the positive response that I got for WorkShare Scheduler.  

WorkShare Scheduler is a household management scheduler that allows roommates to efficiently manage their shared household chores: 

- Want to get rid of those sticky notes from your refrigerators? This scheduler maintains all your tasks.
- Want to see what your roommates upcoming schedule looks like? Our 'Group Schedule' provides you the visibility.
- Ever stuck with an assignment and can't do the weekend's house cleaning? No worries! You can now swap your weekend task with any of your available roommates.
- Forgot to pay the electricity bill? Well, no more excuses, you will have to take up penalties at WorkShare Scheduler.    
Wondering what kind of penalties? It could be anything like taking all your roommates out for lunch or a dinner. 

That's how we motivate everyone here at WorkShare Scheduler to follow their household chores in a fun way and also in a timely and more systematic manner.
